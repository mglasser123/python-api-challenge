# python-api-challenge

I received help on this homework in office hours and from this source: https://hvplot.holoviz.org/reference/geopandas/points.html

In the Weather.py file my linear regressions were able to run but I needed to run the cell with the regression formula each time before running the regression for each data point. Also I am not sure why it reads "None" after each statement of R value but the code runs correctly and the regression models and r^2 values should be correct.
